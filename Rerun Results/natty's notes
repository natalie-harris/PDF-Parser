What information should be in the new dataframe?
Stage 1-3 results

I'm going to make a separate df because it would be easier than modifying current df logic

Here's the current df format:
area,Latitude,Longitude,Year,Outbreak,Source,File Name

Stage 1-3 Results File Name Format: output<x> (where <x> is a unique number like with the results<x> files)
New df should have this format:
File Name, Stage 1 Results, Stage 2 Results, Stage 3 Results
