Chemical control in forest pest management\
Stephen B. Holmes,1 Chris J.K. MacQuarrie2\
Abstractâ€”Chemical insecticides have been an important tool in the management of forest insect\
pests in Canadian forests. Aerial application of insecticides began in the 1920s and expanded greatly\
after World War II with the widespread adoption of DDT primarily for the suppression of eastern spruce\
budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana Clemens (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), and other defoliating\
insects. Significant progress was made in the development of new chemical insecticides and\
formulations including fenitrothion and tebufenozide, as well as technology for the application of\
insecticides against various insect pests. However, widespread opposition to the use of chemical\
insecticides in forest management has led to significant reductions in the number of insecticides\
registered for use in Canadian forests. Developments in the past 20 years have focussed on new\
insecticides, formulations, and technologies that seek to limit the impacts on non-target organisms and\
subsequent ecosystem effects. These developments have resulted in significant improvements in the\
management of traditional management targets, such as the eastern spruce budworm (Choristoneura\
fumiferana (Clemens); Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) but also the management of invasive species,\
especially wood-boring beetles (Coleoptera: Buprestidae, Cerambycidae).\
Introduction\
Early chemical insecticides were derived either\
from plants (botanicals) or from inorganic\
compounds. For example, indigenous peoples\
have extracted rotenone from the roots of tropical\
and subtropical plants of the family Fabaceae for\
centuries and used the compound to catch fish.\
More recently, since about the 1930s, rotenone\
has been used in fisheries management to eradicate\
undesirable fish species, and in agriculture to\
control insect pests of fruit, vegetable and forage\
crops, as well as to kill fleas (Siphonaptera), ticks\
(Acari: Ixodidae, Argasidae), and mites (Acari) on\
pets and livestock (McClay 2000; Anonymous\
2007). Nicotine, a botanical insecticide extracted\
from tobacco, Nicotiana Linnaeus (Solonaceae),\
was used as a plant spray in parts of Europe\
as early as 1690 and was in general use by the\
mid 19th century (Schmeltz 1971). Likewise,\
the botanical insecticide pyrethrum, sold as\
a powder made from ground Chrysanthemum\
Linnaeus (Asteraceae) flowers, was used in the\
home to control body lice and crawling insects\
starting in about the mid 19th century (Glynne-\
Jones 2001).\
Inorganic insecticides (contact insecticides\
containing metals or sulphur) have a much longer\
history of use than botanical compounds. By the\
9th century AD the Chinese were using arsenic-\
containing compounds to control garden insects\
(Fishell 2013), and Homer described the use\
of sulphur as a fumigant in his epic poem\
The Odyssey written in the 8th century BCE.\
In 1893, lead arsenate was developed by the\
United States of America Federal Bureau of\
Entomology for control of gypsy moth, Lymantria\
dispar (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Erebidae), in\
Massachusetts, United States of America (Metcalf\
and Flint 1939; Spear 2005). Because of its efficacy\
and other desirable properties (e.g., persistence),\
lead arsenate was rapidly adopted for use in agri-\
culture worldwide, in particular to control codling\
moth, Cydia pomonella Linnaeus (Lepidoptera:\
Tortricidae), in apple, Malus domestica Borkhausen\
(Rosaceae) orchards (Peryea 1998).\
