8. 1943: Two well-developed infestations of the spruce budworm in Sioux Lookout Region and Lake Nipigon-Geraldton Region.
9. 1945: A notable extension of the spruce budworm outbreak in western Ontario was discovered independently by foresters of the Ontario-Minnesota Pulp and Paper Co., and by forest insect rangers, in late July and early August.
10. 1946-1955: The Lac Seul infestation expanded rapidly after its discovery in 1945.
11. 1944-1955: The Lake Nipigon Infestation expanded steadily from its discovery in 1943 until 1948.
12. 1948: New areas of heavy defoliation were discovered to the south of the main area on Sibley and Black Bay peninsulas and between Gurney and Pays Plat on the north shore of Lake Superior.
13. 1949: The Lake Nipigon infestation, which has been exceedingly active during the past six or seven years, has shown a marked decline in practically all areas.

-Spruce budworm infestations in the Lac Seul and Lake Nipigon regions of northwestern Ontario between 1937 and 1955
-First severe defoliation within the epicenters of the infestations occurred in 1939 in the Lac Seul region and in 1937 or 1938 in the Lake Nipigon region
-Expansion beyond the epicenters did not occur until the mortality of balsam fir had commenced
-Increase of the budworm population to the infestation level occurred abruptly
-Relatively small and scattered representation of the primary hosts gave no protection from severe damage
-Potential for future losses within the areas affected by 1955 is almost double the amount destroyed
-Forest cover in the areas described in general terms, with balsam fir and white spruce forming a small part of the volume of the forest cover
-Estimated that approximately 17 million cords of pulpwood were destroyed due to the infestations
Specific SBW outbreaks in specific years and locations mentioned in the text are as follows:
1. Lake Nipigon and Sioux Lookout-Hudson infestation in 1943: The presence of the budworm in scattered locations such as Hawk Lake near Kenora and Pays Plat on Lake Superior was evident only after intensive searching.
2. Sibley-Black Bay infestation in 1946: The first indication of defoliation damage in the Sibley-Black Bay area came from Pie Island, immediately southwest of Sibley Peninsula.
3. Gurney-Pays Plat infestation in 1948: Serious defoliation throughout any appreciable area did not occur until 1948.
4. Lake-of-the-Woods infestation in 1948: Heavy defoliation was reported over a widespread area in 1948.
5. Sibley-Black Bay infestation from 1948 onwards: The infestation increased in both area and intensity from 1948 onwards.
6. Lake Nipigon infestation decline in 1949: The main Lake Nipigon infestation declined as a unit, even in areas where defoliation had occurred for only one to three years.
7. Main Lac Seul infestation from 1952 onwards: The infestation developed as numerous patches that later coalesced, spreading outwards year after year.
Please note that the specific locations mentioned in the text, such as Lake Nipigon, Sioux Lookout-Hudson, Sibley-Black Bay, Gurney-Pays Plat, and Lake-of-the-Woods, can be located on a map.
