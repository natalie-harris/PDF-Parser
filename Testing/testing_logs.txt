Test 1
Idea: This is simply the first documented run of parser 2.
Prompt 1: "You are a scientist extracting data from research papers about Spruce Budworm (SBW) infestations \
                            and outbreaks. You are to log every instance in which the text refers to a Spruce Budworm outbreak \
                            during any years and region. You must include the range of years and specific region data. The \
                            region must be locatable on a map. Be as specific as possible. General locations like 'study site' \
                            or 'tree stand #3' are not relevant. Include outbreaks whose existence is uncertain. Never include \
                            research citations from the text. It is of the utmost importance that you only output verbatim \
                            sentences from the text, and nothing else."
Prompt 2: "You are a computer analyzing a text for scientists on spruce budworm (SBW) outbreaks/infestations. \
                            You are to log every instance where the text mentions whether or not an outbreak/infestation \
                            occured during a specific year or range of years and at a specific or general region. Write every \
                            instance in the following format exactly: The location, then the year, whether there was or was \
                            not an outbreak/infestation (always a yes or no), and then a new line. This data must be in csv \
                            file format. Never include the header or any labels. If an outbreak lasts multiple years, write \
                            the 'year' feature as 'first_year-last_year'. There MUST be a dash in between the two years. The \
                            year section must have no alphabetic characters. For example, it cannot say 'approximately *year*' \
                            or 'unknown'. It is of the utmost importance that we have as many years and locations of data as \
                            possible. References to other authors and papers are irrelevant. Only log specific instances of \
                            SBW outbreaks. If the authors are uncertain of an outbreak's existence, the 'outbreak' column for \
                            that outbreak should be 'uncertain'"
Prompt 3: "You are a computer made to give scientists town names within an area. You will be given a location \
                            in North America. Your task is to give a town that belongs at that location to be used as a \
                            locality string for GEOLocate software. If the area is very remote, give the nearest town. Put \
                            it in csv format as the following: \"city, state, country\". It is of the utmost importance that \
                            you print only the one piece of data, and absolutely nothing else. You must output a city name, \
                            even if the given area is very large or very remote."
CSV File(s): Testing/testing_data/test1.csv
Analysis/Results: Reasonable results, but ~190 actual 1's predicted to be 0. ~40% data lost across the board after location \
                    matching
CM: (Top is predicted, left is actual)
Before LM:
    0   1

After LM:

Test 2:
Idea: Second stage prompt for performs rather poorly at getting specific location out of output from stage 1, even when desired \
        output is obvious. Attempt to modify prompt 2 to decrease data loss from LM

Analysis/Results: Not much of an improvement.


Test 3:
Idea: AI Group 2 performed rather well with location data and poorly with outbreak readings. AI Group 6 performed 
    well with outbreak readings and poorly with location data. 

Prompt 0: "You are a list-maker making a comma-separated list of sources for research papers about spruce budworms. \
                            You are given an excerpt from the text and must determine where the data is coming from. Your possible list items are: \

Test 4:
Idea: Different version of test 3 that asks for the sentences that provide evidence for the data. Getting individual sources for each piece of \
        data has not been working well.

Test 5:
Idea: I think that much of the actual-1/predicted-0 error is because the parser is filling in zeros between individual dates for outbreaks (where the
        paper mentions an outbreak starting in a year, but not the rest of the years.) Therefore, I am going to try to change postprocessing so that it only 
        fills in zeros between ranges of years, and not if one of the endpoints is an individual year.
Prompts: All prompts are the same as test 3

Test 6:
Idea: I need to add information about the source of the data, so I am adding the instruction to include a sentence describing the source at the end of each entry

Test 7:
Idea: I want to test the parser out on multiple different papers sourced from PMC, and check each one's validity individually.
        Paper 1: PMC6168141
        Paper 1 Results: No data found. There was no specific data in the paper to justify creating data

Prompt 2: "You are a computer analyzing a text for scientists on spruce budworm (SBW) outbreaks/infestations. \
                You are to log every instance where the text mentions whether or not an outbreak/infestation \
                occured during a specific year or range of years and at a specific geographic location. Write every \
                instance in the following format exactly: The geographic location, then the year, whether there was or was \
                not an outbreak/infestation (always a yes or no), a sentence from the excerpt that gives evidence for the \
                outbreak, geographic location, and years (with NO commas), and then a new line. This data must be in csv \
                file format. Never include the header or any labels. The geographic location must be something like a city, \
                a county, a specific lake, or anything that is locatable on a map. If an outbreak lasts multiple years, \
                write the 'year' feature as 'first_year-last_year'. There MUST be a dash in between the two years. The \
                year section must have no alphabetic characters. For example, it cannot say 'approximately *year*' \
                or 'unknown'. It is of the utmost importance that we have as many years and locations of data as \
                possible. References to other authors and papers are irrelevant. Only log specific instances of \
                SBW outbreaks. If the authors are uncertain of an outbreak's existence, the 'outbreak' column for \
                that outbreak should be 'uncertain'"
Prompt 3: "You are a computer made to give scientists town names within an area. You will be given a location \
                in North America. Your task is to give a town that belongs at that location to be used as a \
                locality string for GEOLocate software. If the area is very remote, give the nearest town. Put \
                it in csv format as the following: \"city, state, country\". It is of the utmost importance that \
                you print only the one piece of data, and absolutely nothing else. You must output a city name, \
                even if the given area is very large or very remote."
